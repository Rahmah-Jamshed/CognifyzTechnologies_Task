# CognifyzTechnologies_Task
This repository contains my Data Science internship project at Cognifyz Technologies, where I performed data analysis, feature engineering, and built predictive models to estimate restaurant ratings. Tools used include Python, pandas, scikit-learn, and seaborn. The project highlights my skills in EDA, visualization, and machine learning.

## 🔍 Key Highlights

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
  Data cleaning, missing value handling, and variable distribution analysis.

- **Descriptive & Geospatial Analysis:**  
  City and cuisine-wise trends, restaurant location mapping using latitude/longitude.

- **Feature Engineering:**  
  Created meaningful new features to improve model accuracy.

- **Predictive Modeling:**  
  Built regression models (Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest) to predict restaurant ratings.

- **Data Visualization:**  
  Used `matplotlib` and `seaborn` to create impactful visualizations for insights.
