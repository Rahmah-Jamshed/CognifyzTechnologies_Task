# CognifyzTechnologies_Task
This repository contains my Data Science internship project at Cognifyz Technologies, where I performed data analysis, feature engineering, and built predictive models to estimate restaurant ratings. Tools used include Python, pandas, scikit-learn, and seaborn. The project highlights my skills in EDA, visualization, and machine learning.
